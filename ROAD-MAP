== Improvements

The obvious potential improvements are ported the package to additional operating systems and web servers.  This would require minimal, but completely worth-while structure changes Plow::Generator class.
  
  * Move all system administrative logic to model classes and redesign the class around the builder pattern to allow to construct user-determined classes dynamically at run-time
  * Move all data validations to the same model classes or to new classes entirely, depending on the needs at the time
  * More specific data validations
  * Handing of more complex web application structures
  * automatic deployment of web applications from github
  * better argument parsing and including option flags as needed
