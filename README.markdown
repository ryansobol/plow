MOTIVATION
----------

There exists numerous software products for controlling and/or managing a unix-based operating systems and web servers.  So, why did I decide to write yet another?  Simply, I created plow for two main reasons:

1. To contribute back to the open-source world after 17 years of consumption.

2. To prove to myself, without a shadow of a doubt, that I have the skill to design, develop, and deploy a ruby application on my own.

CONTRIBUTING
------------
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
